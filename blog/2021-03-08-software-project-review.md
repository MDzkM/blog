A review of three projects I'm going to be working on. This year I'm taking the software project course and there are three different products available for development which are Pilar Home Industry, TBCare, and BisaGo. I am going to briefly explain them below.

<!--truncate-->

**1. Pilar Home Industry**

The first product that was introduced by the lecturer's assistant during class was Pilar Home Industry. This app is an online marketplace with an android based platform and a separate web based platform for the admin page. Being a marketplace, Pilar offers the basic features of buying products, search for products, transaction history, and donations. It is aimed towards social communities and attempts to help small businesses grow. Aside from purchasing products regularly, users can also pre-order them. The interface of this app is fairly simple and easy to understand without neglecting the modern feel and a clean user interface.

For purchases, Pilar provides several options to do the transaction. The first option is the more conventional method, bank transfer. And the other option is to pay when the product has been delivered (cash on delivery).
